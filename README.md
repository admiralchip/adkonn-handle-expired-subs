Konnichiwa! Handle Expired Subscriptions: A WordPress plugin that can be used to delete or cancel expired subscriptions.

There is a bug in Konnichiwa! that tells a user who has an active subscription that their subscription is expired. This is happens if the user had a previous subscription that expired and they subsequently renewed their subscription.

This plugin can be used to change the status of expired subscriptions from active (1) to cancelled (2). It can also be used to delete expired subscriptions to clear the database.

#Usage:

1. Download the plugin and install it. Make sure that Konnichiwa is installed first.
2. Activate the plugin. That's it!
